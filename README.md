# Hello, my name is Vinicius Trevisan 🙋🏻‍♂️ 

I am a software engineering student at PUC-PR, focused on back-end development.
I work at Vivo - Telefonica Brasil, and am focused on automating manual Microsoft Excel and PowerBI work, mostly using Python.
I am also learning SpringBoot, through a CodeWithMosh course. Also getting better everyday with DSA, practicing LeetCode for technical interviews.
